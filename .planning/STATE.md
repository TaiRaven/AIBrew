# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-28)

**Core value:** Log a complete brew in under 60 seconds from the counter, so every session gets captured and nothing is lost.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Brew Log Core (context gathered 2026-05-05)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 6 (Brew History & Management)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase (Wave 3 next)
Status: Executing — Wave 2 (05-02) complete; Wave 3 (05-03) next
Last activity: 2026-05-07 — Plan 05-02 complete; edit modal PATCH save verified (Plan 01 delivered implementation)

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Phase 3 — Complete (2026-05-05)

All 4 plans executed and UAT approved. RECIPE-02 verified with non-admin aibrew_user account.

Lessons from Phase 3 UAT:

- `sysparm_display_value: 'all'` required in Table API list fetches when using `display()`/`value()` field helpers — without it, helpers return empty strings (fields are plain strings, not `{value, display_value}` objects)
- `@servicenow/react-components Button` ignores `display: flex; flex-direction: column` on `style` prop — use native `<button display: block>` for custom card layouts (BeanCard is the canonical pattern)
- `Modal size="lg"` + `overflowY: auto` inner div is the correct create-form pattern; custom `position: absolute` inside `<Modal>` conflicts with the component's own positioning

Code review open items (03-REVIEW.md): pending — run /gsd-code-review 3 after phase.

## Phase 1 — Complete (2026-04-30)

All 6 plans executed and verified. Scope prefix: `x_664529_aibrew`.

Lessons from Phase 1 UAT:

- `Modal` footer action events fire as `e.detail.payload.action` not `e.detail.action`
- `NowRecordListConnected` has no `query`/`filter` prop — use direct Table API fetch with `sysparm_query=active=true`
- `FormActionBar` is the correct save mechanism inside `RecordProvider`; no programmatic `gForm.save()` in Fluent adapter
- `onFormSubmitCompleted` on `RecordProvider` is reliable for post-save callbacks

Code review open items (01-REVIEW.md):

- CR-01: sysId path injection — validate `/^[0-9a-f]{32}$/i` before Table API URL interpolation
- CR-02: fetch error shows false empty state — add error flag to distinguish auth failure from empty list
- CR-03: navigateToView in render phase — move to useEffect
- CR-04: UiPage.$id key mismatch — investigate aibrew-home key generation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Scope prefix: `x_664529_aibrew` (company code: `664529`)
- Recipe preset is bean-agnostic (D-01) — no bean reference on recipe table; bean paired at brew-time in Phase 4
- Brew ratio (water/dose) is computed at render time, never stored (D-03) — no ratio column on recipe table
- Recipe field names are locked as Phase 4 schema contract: name, method, equipment, dose_weight_g, water_weight_g, grind_size, notes, active
- Roadmap: 3-table model (roaster / bean / bean_purchase) chosen — architecturally correct, required for ledger inventory pattern
- Roadmap: Basic in-page timer included in v1 (BREW-04); screen-off persistence deferred to v2 (BREW-12)
- Roadmap: Low-stock threshold hardcoded at 50 g for v1 (INV-03); user-configurable threshold deferred to v2 (INV-05)
- Roadmap: Analytics phase (6) built last — useful only after real brews accumulate
- RecipeSection.tsx: equipment field omitted from list fetch per D-08 — detail view only; card shows name/method/ratio
- RecipeSection.tsx: isMobile breakpoint ≤400px; bottom-sheet modal on mobile, centered overlay on desktop
- RecipeSection.tsx: sys_id field may be object or scalar — handled with `typeof r.sys_id === 'object' ? value(r.sys_id) : r.sys_id`

### Decisions (Phase 5 — Plan 01)

- History list uses sysparm_offset pagination (first paginated list in codebase); append pattern: setBrews(prev => [...prev, ...results])
- Hard DELETE to Table API introduced — 204 No Content; never call res.json() on DELETE response
- HistoryView contains both edit modal and delete confirmation modal in one file (Plans 2 & 3 add full wiring)
- History tab enabled in TopNav and HomeView tile made active (D-14/D-15/D-16)

### Decisions (Phase 5 — Plan 02)

- Plan 01 over-delivered: complete edit modal wiring (handleEditSave, populateEditForm, EquipmentPickerInline, all 8 form fields) was included in commit 242b4b3, making Plan 02 a verification-only step with no code changes
- Edit modal PATCH uses SYS_ID_RE.test guard (CR-01 pattern) and X-UserToken: g_ck header (T-05-06 mitigation)
- recipe field intentionally omitted from PATCH body per D-08 (historical artifact, not editable)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. CR-01 through CR-04 from code review are tracked in 01-REVIEW.md and should be addressed in a gap closure phase or at start of Phase 2.
